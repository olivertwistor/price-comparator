# Podcast Planner
This application helps the user keep track of where specific products are cheapest, based on user selected stores, discounts, affiliate deals and such things. Note that this application doesn't do any automatic price checks, the user has to manually put them in.

## Who is this for?
If you want to know the cheapest place to buy certain products, but don't want to use a service such as Pricerunner that has a predetermined set of companies from which they get prices, this application may be suitable for you.

## Prerequisites
This application is written in PHP and uses CodeIgniter as its framework. Thus, you will need:

* [PHP 5.6 or newer][6]
* a web server capable of running PHP, for example [Apache][1] or [IIS][4]
* a database driver such as *mysqli*, *postgre* and *sqlite3* (please refer to [CodeIgniter's server requirements][5] for information which database drivers are specifically supported)

## Installation instructions
More info is coming once the first release is out.

## Usage
More info is coming once the first release is out.

## Licensing
This application is licensed under the MIT License, and so is the framework [CodeIgniter][7] that I use. For detailed license terms, please read [LICENSE][8] for this application, and [LICENSE-CodeIgniter][11] for CodeIgniter.
